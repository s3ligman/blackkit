        <h2>COMING SOON: Online Project in September</h2>
      </span>

      <p>40 years ago, the one-month KONZIL convened by artists became the foundation stone of the internationally unique performance archive DIE SCHWARZE LADE | BLACK KIT. On the initiative of the artist residences in Stuttgart and Hamburg, about 70 artists from Europe and the FRG met in Stuttgart in September 1981; they lived, thought and worked together. In the anniversary year 2021, the council is to be reappraised scientifically and artistically for the first time - online, in the form of a print publication and with a performance series. </p>

      <p><h1>History</h1></p>
      <p>The name BLACKKIT for the Performance Art Archive goes back to the project DAS KONZIL. In 1981, about 70 artists from Germany and other European countries met at the invitation of the artist’s houses in Stuttgart and Hamburg with the aim of closely living and working together. <br> <br>
During the KONZIL, the artists met every evening at a central table to reflect on what they had experienced and to ask fundamental questions about art and discussing fundamental positions of developments in the fields of interaction, intervention, communication and intermedial arts. There was voting, arguing, and discussion; the meetings were carefully documented. <br> <br>
The founding moment of the international performance archive was the decision to preserve all the materials, created during Das KONZIL, in two black office cabinets. In the course of the question of a form of documentation of the project, the idea of a transportable container - a drawer - arose, which was to be transported from event to event, from meeting to meeting. It should keep the information, ideas, documents, relics, tools and symbols energetically present.<br> <br>
Rather, it is a sculpture of a process of collecting that has been going on for 40 years today and a source of inspiration for the present.<br> <br>
The Archive underwent many transformations. The first one was a question of material: the heavy wooden wardrobe was replaced by light metal cabinets according to the collection’s constant growth. The next transformation became necessary around 1993, because the material was not just compiled from various meetings but also raised questions surpassing mere documentation. It evolved into archive structures, which require a different approach on structure and processing.<br> <br>
The name DIE SCHWARZEN LADE finally became BLACKKIT ('black kit/drawer'; lit. trans.: ='black load/charge'), The BLACKKIT was born.
